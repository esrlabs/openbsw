## Overview

Eclipse OpenBSW is an open source SDK to build professional, high quality embedded software products. 
It is a software stack specifically designed and developed for automotive applications.

This repository provides the complete code, documentation and a reference example
that works out of the box without any specific hardware requirements (any POSIX platform)
allowing developers to get up and running quickly.

## Target Audience

* **Open Source Enthusiasts**: Enthusiasts and hobbyists passionate about automotive technology
  and interested in contributing to open source projects, collaborating with like-minded
  individuals and exploring new ideas and projects in the automotive domain.

* **Embedded Systems Developers**: Developers specializing in embedded systems programming,
  microcontroller firmware development and real-time operating systems (RTOS), who are interested
  in automotive applications.

* **Automotive Engineers**: Professionals working in the automotive industry, including engineers,
  designers and technicians, who are interested in developing and improving automotive
  technologies, systems and components.

* **Students and Researchers**: Students, researchers, and academic institutions interested in
  learning about automotive technologies, conducting research, and exploring innovative solutions
  in automotive areas.
